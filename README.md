# Protein-docking
Protein docking projet (Master's second year main project)

The goal of this project is to implement a method to predict receptor-ligand interaction surface.
Main steps are : sampling (positioning the ligand around the receptor), minisation of energy, scoring of results and selection of best results.

Below is an example of result, with the receptor (grey) the ligand predicted (blue) and the experimental result (red)
